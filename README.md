Exploratory data analysis of Tennis data

Playing with the tennis point by point raw data uploaded by https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_pointbypoint.

My current goal is to figure out if there are "important" points or "clutch" points which predict the overall winner of a tennis match. For eg: does the winner of more points at a score of 30-30 also end up winning the match?
